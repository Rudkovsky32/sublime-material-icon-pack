# Description

**Sublime Material Icon Pack** is heavily inspired by, and fits very well the [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) for [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/). It contains a total of 44 icons, with 4 different themes and 11 different accent colors for each. ICNS format for macOS up to 512x512 resolution and ICO format for Windows up to 256x256 resolution are included. For a more appealing look, installing the [Material Theme Appbar](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme-appbar) addon is highly recommended.
